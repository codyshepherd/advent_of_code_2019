# Advent of Code 2019

Solutions to challenges using Python 3.7.

Very brief discussions of solutions at the top of each module. My goal is
to write brief, readable solutions which leverage Python's strengths and reuse
code wherever possible.

### To Install & Run

* create and activate a virtual environment (I like to use virtualenvwrapper)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python3 _.py`

Note that until `7_imp.py`, input filenames are hard-coded in the solution
source.
